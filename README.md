# Football_API_Android

## The Brief

Create an app using an API that you find interesting.
If you're having difficulties finding an API, take a look at https://github.com/public-apis/
public-apis/blob/master/README.md.
Use the best engineering practices wherever you can. You should be looking to demonstrate the following values:
• performance
• readability
• maintainability • testability
• scalability
• simplicity
Keep a clear separation of concerns within your app - use your preferred pattern for this.
